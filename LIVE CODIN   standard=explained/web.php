The code starts by declaring the routes for the application.

The first route is /brief, which is a controller class that handles all of the resources in this directory.

Next, there are two routes declared: one for /tache and another for apprenant.

These are both controllers with their respective resource classes.

The code declares the following routes: /brief - BriefController::class /tache - TacheController::class /apprenant - apprenantController::class
