 The code is a class that extends Migration.

 The up() function is called when the migration starts and down() is called when it ends.

 The code creates two tables, apprenant_brief and briefs, in which to store data about an individual's brief history.

 The code attempts to create a class that extends Migration.

 The class will contain two methods, one for up() and the other for down().

 The first method in the class, up(), will be called when the migration is executed.

 In this method, it will create a table in which to store its data.

 It will also increment the id column of this table with each new row inserted into it.

 It will also set foreign keys on these columns so that they point back to their respective ids of their respective tables (apprenant_id and brief_id).

 Finally, it sets a cascade delete on these columns so that if an apprenant or brief is deleted from their respective tables, then all rows in this table are deleted
