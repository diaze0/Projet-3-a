The code is a simple database model for storing information about tasks.

The code has two tables: one for the task and one for the person who is doing it.

The first line of code creates an instance of the Task class, which is used to store data about each task that needs to be done.

The second line sets up a relationship between this new instance and another table called Tache, which stores information about people who are assigned to do these tasks.

This relationship uses a belongsToMany() method on both classes so that they can share data with each other without duplicating any values in either table.

The code creates a new model called Tache.

The code has the following methods: -hasMany(tache::class) -Tache()
